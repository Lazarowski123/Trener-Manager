# Trener Manager

I created this application just to learn how angular works. It's not refined

I wanted to create, in the simplest way, an application that uses several basic functions that are offered by Angular.

## With this app you can:

- Add new customer
- Delete selected client
- Select customers from the list

## In this project I wanted to learn and use:

- HTTP Client
- Routing
- Template Driven Forms
- Lazy Loading
- Resolver Service

## I learnt about:

- Components
- Modules
- Template Syntax
- Directives
- Services
- Observable
- Lifecycle Hooks
